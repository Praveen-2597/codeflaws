# Codeflaws
The Codeflaws benchmark is a collection of C programs with 4085 defects. Each defect are  where the dataset is crawled from [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/)

## Download:
Codeflaws is available for download at [tar-link](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~release/codeflaws/codeflaws.tar.gz)

## Structure of each subject folder
All the subject programs are in the benchmark directory. Each subject folder is named using the following convention: 
&lt;contestid&gt;-&lt;problem&gt;-bug-&lt;buggy-submisionid&gt;-&lt;accepted-submissionid&gt;
Each folder contains:
- Buggy submission with name &lt;contestid&gt;-&lt;problem&gt;-&lt;buggy-submisionid&gt;.c
- Accepted submission with name &lt;contestid&gt;-&lt;problem&gt;-&lt;accepted-submisionid&gt;.c
- Two sets of test scripts: 
  1. Repair Test script (test suite given to repair tools for generating repair): test-genprog.sh is for search-based repair tools (GenProg, SPR, Prophet), test-angelix.sh is for Angelix as it requires inserting special instrumentation.
  2. Test script for patch validation (held-out test suite): test-valid.sh is for validating the correctness of patches
- Test input files: input[0-9]+ file used by Test suite (i), and  heldout-input[0-9]+ file used by Test suite (ii)
- Test output files: output[0-9]+ file used by Test suite (i), and  heldout-output[0-9]+ file used by Test suite (ii)
- Makefile for compiling the buggy submission. This contains the CFLAGS options recommended by Codeforces. To compile the accepted submission, use the command `make FILENAME=10-A-13543524`
- Makefile.genprog for compiling the buggy submission using cilly. This is for GenProg experiments as GenProg works on CIL representation.
- Test configuration for SPR that specify the name for pass/fail test: &lt;contestid&gt;-&lt;problem&gt;-&lt;buggy-submisionid&gt;.c.revlog


## Script for running each repair tool
All the files mentioned below are stored in the all-script directory

### Angelix
Use the following files for running Angelix:
- File for running Angelix: run-version-angelix.sh

### GenProg
Use the following files for running GenProg:
- File for GenProg general configuration: configuration-default
- File for compilation configuration: compile.pl 
- File for running GenProg: run-version-genprog.sh
- File for validating patches generated by GenProg (This script is called from run-version-genprog.sh): validate-fix-genprog.sh 

### SPR
Use the following files for running SPR:
- File for compilation configuration: code-build.py 
- File for test configuration: run-test.py
- File for running SPR: run-version-spr.sh
- File for validating patches generated by SPR (This script is called from run-version-spr.sh): validate-fix-spr.sh 

### Prophet
Use the following files for running Prophet:
- File for compilation configuration: code-build.py 
- File for test configuration: run-test.py
- File for running Prophet: run-version-prophet.sh
- File for validating patches generated by Prophet (This script is called from run-version-prophet.sh): validate-fix-prophet.sh 
- Parameter file with learned model (From Prophet original experiment): para-rext-all.out
